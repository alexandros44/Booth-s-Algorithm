# Booth-s-Algorithm

This code is trying to represent the Booth's Algorithm in the base of 2!

This code takes two unsinged binary numbers at a time. Those two numbers can have whatever number of digits as the want, but they must always have the same lenght. (There is a special code in case of an exception)

Enjoy!!
